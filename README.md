Birmingham Age-Herald, Birmingham State Herald, The Age-Herald, and The Birmingham Age-Herald
Birmingham's The Daily Age-Herald was first published on November 8, 1888, a result of a merger between the Birmingham Iron Age, founded by Charles Roberts and Frank A. Duval in 1874,and The Daily Herald, a rival newspaper founded by William Pinckard and Frank O'Brien in 1887. Pinckard, a lawyer and an early industrialist in the young city, retained ownership of the paper, while O'Brien, a businessman and, later, Birmingham mayor, acted as the editor and manager.

While the paper functioned as a mouthpiece for the Democratic Party, it covered the rise of the Populist movement in Alabama, which coincided with the Birmingham Age-Herald's birth. Of particular interest is the coverage of Reuben F. Kolb's bid for governor in 1894, in which the paper stated, "Scat! That's What the People Said to Captain Kolb!" (Volume 20, Number 228). The paper also covered the industrial rise of Birmingham in its early years; the establishment of the Tennessee Coal, Iron, and Railroad Company occurred in the same year as the first issues of the Birmingham Age-Herald. During the "New South" era of the late nineteenth century, Birmingham emerged as an industrial center because of the close proximity of iron ore, coal, limestone, and dolomite,the major components for creating steel and iron.
